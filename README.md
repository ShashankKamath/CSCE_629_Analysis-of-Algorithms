# CSCE_629_Analysis-of-Algorithms
This is part of the project for the course CSCE 629-Analysis of Algorithms at Texas A&amp;M University.

Path bandwidth is the smallest edge bandwidth along the path. The problem to solve is: given a weighted graph and 2 vertices s and t, find an s-t path of the largest bandwidth. This project is implemented to solve maximum bandwidth pass problem of a random undirected graph. Basically, it includes functions as below.

A graph generator in order to generate random undirected graph with two ways, degree or possibility.
A heap structure to be used as a data structure storing fringe node while doing Dijstra’s algorithm.
An optimized union and find algorithm to be used in maximum spanning tree algorithm
3 routing algorithms
* Dijstra’s with no heap
* Dijstra’s with heap
* Maximum spanning tree with Kruskal’s algorithm
